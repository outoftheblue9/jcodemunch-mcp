    quoted source snippet whose escapes were expanded before they reached the
    file -- ends the row mid-sentence and starts a one-cell row after it. GFM
    renders both as garbage and a line-based reader sees a malformed row.

    ⚠ `_archaeology_paths`' own floor cannot see it: the path regex matches
    the FIRST half, so the count is unchanged and `>= 480` holds over a broken
    table. A guard whose numerator and denominator move together is the
    cache-hit-rate shape (08-27) -- it had to be a different question, not a
    tighter floor.

    ⚠ Asserted over the whole file rather than section 1, because a split row
    is corruption wherever it lands.

    ⚠⚠ **The predicate is PIPE BALANCE and the property is one logical row per
    line; they are not the same thing, and this says so rather than letting a
    reader assume otherwise.** A split whose second half happened to both open
    and close with `|` would pass. No cell in the file has that shape and it
    takes a contrived one to build, so the proxy is kept and named instead of
    replaced by a parser. The other direction fails LOUDLY and deliberately: a
    fenced block whose lines start with `|` would break this, the file carries
    no fences today, and a future one is worth a decision rather than silence.

    """The direction neither guard asked, and a typo slipped through it (#821).

    ⚠⚠ **Two guards over one ledger, and the gap was between them.**
    `test_ledger_is_well_formed` asks whether an entry has its fields;
    `test_every_ledgered_replacement_exists_and_collects` asks whether the
    REPLACEMENT is real; `.claude/hooks/dod_checklist.py` asks whether every
    removed test has an entry. None asked whether an entry names a test that
    actually left. A row reading `..._here_needs_the_ordinal_stripped` for a
    test called `..._here_that_needs_the_ordinal_stripped` therefore passed
    this file, failed the checklist, and sat wrong for two commits.

    ⚠⚠ **Against the MERGE BASE, never against HEAD.** A test added AND
    retired inside one branch never existed on `main` and owes no row, so a
    HEAD-relative version of this check would demand one. ⚠ The WORKING TREE
    against the base, not `base...HEAD`: the commit hook runs this tier
    BEFORE the commit exists, so a retirement and its ledger row arriving in
    one commit -- the ordinary squash outcome -- could never pass the hook
    under the committed-diff form; #797's first commit was refused exactly so.
    After the commit the two forms agree, and in CI a clean checkout makes
    them identical, which is the backstop against a local deletion that is
    never committed.

    ⚠⚠ **Scoped to the rows this branch ADDED to the ledger -- the diff of
    `harness/retired.json` against the base -- never to a row's `commit` sha.**
    The first shipped draft keyed on the sha and failed CI on twelve historical
    rows: this repo squash-merges with `--delete-branch`, so every row's
    `commit` names a branch sha a fresh clone does not have. It passed here
    because this box still held the dangling objects, which is a test green on
    one machine and red on the next for a reason neither can see (#437). A
    ledger `commit` is provenance a reader follows by hand, not a pointer a
    guard can dereference. The ledger diff is the identity that survives both
    a squash and a rebase.

    ⚠⚠ **AN UNESTABLISHABLE BASE FAILS; it must not return green.** The first
    draft returned on a missing `origin/main`, and `actions/checkout` fetches
    ONE ref at depth 1 -- so in the two jobs that collect this file the ref was
    absent, `merge-base` exited 128, and the guard passed having asked nothing.
    A green ratchet and an absent ratchet look identical, and this repo has
    paid for that twice (Practice 6's `--depth=1`). `fast-harness` and `full`
    carry `fetch-depth: 0` for this test; if the base cannot be found, the
    remedy is in the message rather than in a silence.

    ⚠ A removed `def` is matched at any indentation, so a retired test method
    inside a class counts; column 0 only left such a retirement no passing
    route. Still anchored at the diff's `-`, never a substring match.
